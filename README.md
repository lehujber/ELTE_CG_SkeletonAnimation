# ELTE_CG_SkeletonAnimation
Final project I created for my computer graphics course at ELTE. It does not complete 100% of the points but it is pretty close.

Looks for opengl pack at T:\\

Written with opengl 4.6.

A base project was used, my work is in MyApp.cpp and MyApp.h, and in the shader files.
